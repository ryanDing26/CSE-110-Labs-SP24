Question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related in the manner that service workers can be considered a part of the process for a project to become gracefully degraded. Service workers working in the background are a fallback to one's page not working correctly, which is the entire basis behind the concept of graceful degradation, where some form of alternative is shown if an environment does not meet a page's system requirements.
