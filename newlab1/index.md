# Ryan Ding's User Page

Welcome to my user page for CSE 110: Software Engineering! I will be updating this throughout the quarter as I progress through the course, but for now, here is a short introduction to who I am:

My name is Ryan Ding, and I am a second-year computer science major at **UC San Diego**. I am interested in the intersection of machine learning with the biotechnology industry, having taken an interest into using complex models to solve critical healthcare problems in the world. I have slowly but surely been working my way through the computer science world, one paper at a time, and I can say that I am truly passionate about the subject! On a more personal side, some of my hobbies include: 

- Dancing
- Basketball
- Software Engineering (as is the point of this class!)

Some of my favorite Git commands are:

- `git fetch` so that I can retrieve my work when I need to, as it gets jumbled up sometimes in my working branches
- `git stash` for when I accidentally forget to branch from main
- `git checkout` to create more branches.

I hope that this is able to give you some insight into what I am passionate about, which if you are not aware about is computer science. My LinkedIn can be located [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryand26/) and I would love to hear more about everyone else who sees this!
